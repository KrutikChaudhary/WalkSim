Refactoring 1: Make a abstract class Walker.java containing abstract method called walk()
so it can be used by other walker subclasses (Example Walker.java, SpiralWalker.java, BreadCrumbWalker.java)
Walker.java class will serve as a common base class, encapsulating shared functionalities that can be inherited
by its subclasses.

Refactoring 2: Extend Walker.java from Walker.java and override walk() method

Refactoring 3: Extend SpiralWalker.java from Walker.java and override walk() method

Refactoring 4: Extend BreadCrumbWalker.java from Walker.java and override walk() method
